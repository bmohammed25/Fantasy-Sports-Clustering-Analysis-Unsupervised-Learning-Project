# Fantasy-Sports-Clustering-Analysis-Unsupervised-Learning-Project
This project applies unsupervised machine learning to analyze and segment fantasy football players based on their performance statistics. Using real-world-style fantasy sports data, the goal is to discover meaningful player groups that can support draft strategy, team optimization, and scouting insights.
🏆 Fantasy Sports Clustering Analysis
Unsupervised Learning Project — Player Segmentation Using Machine Learning

📁 Project Overview

The notebook walks through a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:

🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Dataset contains 476 players and 13 features

Basic statistical summary and distribution analysis

Detecting missing values, skewness, correlations, and outliers

Understanding player performance trends across clubs and positions

⚙️ 2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

Cleaning and preprocessing fields

Scaling numerical features for clustering

Selecting key performance metrics

Handling highly skewed variables

🤖 3. Clustering Techniques Used

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering

Elbow Method to estimate optimal k

Silhouette Coefficients for cluster validation

📊 4. Results & Insights

The final clusters reveal distinct player types such as:

Elite high-scoring players

Balanced all-round performers

Defensive specialists

Low-impact or underperforming players

Visualizations help interpret cluster separation and feature influence.
